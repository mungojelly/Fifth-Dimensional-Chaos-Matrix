FIFTH DIMENSIONAL CHAOS MATRIX
  __________________________


The Fifth Dimensional Chaos Matrix 
is a Discordian programming project. 

It doesn't do anything useful. 

In fact, 
as of this writing, 
it does not do anything at all. 

(What it is supposed to do eventually 
is to be a series of esoteric languages,
   (simulators? environments? agents?) 
built one upon the other.  Which still 
won't be useful, but might be --
interesting?) 

So far there is just one component 
started, the FNOOBLATZ1000.  So far, 
all you can do is enlarge the display 
area of the Fnooblatz, on which it does 
not know how to display anything.  Enjoy! 

Write to me at mungojelly@gmail.com 
if you'd like to contribute a component. 
It shouldn't be too difficult, since 
components of FDCM don't have to do 
anything coherent or predictable. :D
