FIFTH DIMENSIONAL CHAOS MATRIX
  __________________________


The Fifth Dimensional Chaos Matrix 
is a Discordian programming project. 

It doesn't do anything especially useful. 

What it is supposed to do eventually 
is to be a series of esoteric languages,
(simulators? environments? agents?) 
built one upon the other.  Which still 
won't be useful, but might be --
interesting? 

So far there is just one component 
started, the FNOOBLATZ1000.  It now 
knows a dozen commands, enough that 
it's possible to draw simple pictures. 
It's difficult to get it to do 
anything on purpose, but it does look 
pretty if you just hook it up to a 
stream of random numbers! 

Write to me at mungojelly@gmail.com 
if you'd like to contribute a component. 
It shouldn't be too difficult, since 
components of FDCM don't have to do 
anything coherent or predictable. :D 

The license for the entire Fifth 
Dimensional Chaos Matrix is the "DO
WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC 
LICENSE":

(Since while it's possible that a 
lawsuit over this source code could be 
entertaining, I still wouldn't want 
it on my head.)
